When an error happens when exporting the game, it's important to make sure the game files you are using are the originals with no modifications. Randovania only supports unmodified game files.

# Verifying your game files

## Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes

Both games only support the GameCube versions of the game, with uncompressed files in the ISO format.
